#+title: Org mode based Hyde site

A version of Hyde that allows the author to write and publish without
having to write the YAML frontmatter in its files and instead only
having to use Org mode.

*** How to use

To generate the site we can use the =org-converge= gem

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gem install org-converge
org-run org/setup.org
org-run org/development.org
#+END_SRC

If not using the gem, the instructions described in the Org mode
files can could help, read in order as stated above.
